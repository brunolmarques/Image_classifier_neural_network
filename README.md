# AI Programming with Python, Project of a image classifier neural network

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

This repository consists of a Jupyter notebook file, explaining each step of the training phase and predicting output, and two python files with the stacked applications
